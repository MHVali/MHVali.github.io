Mohammad Hassan Vali is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University, Finland. His postdoctoral research is supervised by Prof. Arno Solin, and funded by Finnish Center of Artifical Intelliggence (FCAI). His research is focused on discrete representation learning in deep neural networks. More specifically, his research explores more efficient vector quantization tecniques that find applications in image and speech processing downstream applicaitons such as image compression and generation, 3D Gaussin splatting compression, interpretable AI, speaker anonymization, and voice conversion.

He earned his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering in 2025 from Aalto University, Finland, and his thesis entitled "Vector Quantization in Deep Neural Networks for Speech and Image Processing" was supervised by Prof. Tom BÃ¤ckstrÃ¶m. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Iran in 2014 and 2017, respectively.
