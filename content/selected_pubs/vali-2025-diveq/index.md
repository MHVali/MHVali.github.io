abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion, keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over alternative quantization approaches.
